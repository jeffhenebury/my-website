        <p id="aboutMeStart">Hi!</p>
        <p>I'm Jeff Henebury, a fiction writer and software developer.</p>
        <p>
            In terms of writing: I studied English at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, taking every class with <a href="https://marlonjameswriter.com/" target="_blank">Marlon James</a> that I possibly could.
            After a few more years in Minneapolis, I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to get my MFA from the Helen Zell Writers' Workshop at the University of Michigan.
            I'm currently at work on a novel set in the Gilded Age about a painter who sells out his artistic gifts to make portraits of the fabulously wealthy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of software development: I'm a Computer Science student with Champlain College. On the back end I've worked in Python, Java, and C++.
            I'm interested in becoming a full-stack developer and am taking courses in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. (This website was designed by me.)
        </p>
        <p>
            By day I work for in Communications for the Vermont Department of Health. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-henebury/" target="_blank">You can find me on LinkedIn</a> to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>I live in Burlington, Vermont, with my wife Maya and cat Tip.</p>
