# final

This was my project for a web development class.

I’m a fiction writer in my free time and working towards the completion of a novel.  For my final project, I made myself an author website. This will function as a general place for me to share a bit about myself and link out to my writing available elsewhere online. 
Some author’s websites that I admire and would like to draw inspiration from:

•	N.K. Jemisin. (https://nkjemisin.com/ )
o	Simple and sleek index page with interesting text styling of her name. The menu is clear and the navigation buttons are well styled and easy to use.
•	Catherine Lacey, (https://www.catherinelacey.com/)
o	 Catherine Lacey’s website is wonderfully bananas. I attended an event where someone asked her a question about her site and she said she created it herself. Most author websites struck her as unnecessarily “professional” and thus quite boring. She wanted to channel a chaotic web 1.0 aesthetic.   As she asks deep into the scroll of her site, “When did people stop allowing their websites to be any fun at all?”
•	Callie Collins, (https://www.calliecollins.com/) . 
o	Callie is a friend who graduated from my Creative Writing MFA program with me. She recently signed a two-book publishing deal, which is very exciting. Her site is very basic, but it’s easy to find the information that you need, and the homepage gets across that she’s a writer who’s interested in Texas.

The pages:
Home page (with links to other pages)
•	A brief ‘about me’ bio.
•	Either a photo of me or some illustration.
•	I’m attempting some scrolling text. I have read that it’s considered gauche and passe, but that’s part of what I like about it! I was trying to use some starter JavaScript code from this HubSpot blog tutorial but couldn’t get it to work; using CSS animation, however, I’m having more luck.

“Photos from my life” page
•	Snapshots from Jeff’s life, captions talking about them
•	Irreverent is what I’m going for
“Writing from around the internets” page
•	Links to articles and stories I’ve written
•	Use journo as a start: https://jeffhenebury.journoportfolio.com/ 
•	3 columns: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_three_columns.asp 

“Art that Jeff loves” page
•	Photos of the records I currently have in heaviest rotation, little explanations/ captions of what I think of them
•	Data table of books that I love
“Contact me” page
•	A way to contact me. Ideally this would be an embedded form that folks could write a message and then it would be emailed to me. I’m not sure I have the skills for that yet, so it might just be my email address for now.
